# NewsScrape

Whenever a user visits my site, the app will scrape stories from a news outlet I chose and display the articles for the user. Each scraped article is saved to my applications database. The app currently scrape the news website for:

     * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article

Users are able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database, but I could not connect the saved notes to there specified delete button after they were ceated. Other than that everything is working. All stored comments are visible to every user.
