# NewsScrape

Whenever a user visits my site, the app will scrape stories from a news outlet I chose and display the articles for the user. Each scraped article is saved to my applications database. The app currently scrape the news website for:

     * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article

Users are able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
